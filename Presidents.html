        This man was President from November 22, 1963, to January 20, 1969. He served 1 and a half terms. He was Born the 27th of August 1908, near Stonewall Texas. He died in Austin Texas on the 22nd of January 1973. Johnson ran for the Democratic nomination in the 1960 presidential election. Even though he was unsuccessful in that endeavor, he was chosen by Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts to be his running mate. Johnson was sworn in as Vice President on January 20, 1961.
Two years and ten months later, on November 22, 1963, Johnson took office after President Kennedy's assassination took place. Johnson ran for a full in 1964, winning by a huge amount over Republican opponent Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater. He is one of the few people who has served as President, Vice-President, Senator, and Representative. Johnson was known for his domineering, sometimes abrasive, personality. He had a way of making powerful politicians advance legislation, by being very aggressive this was dubbed the "Johnson treatment." Johnson escalated American involvement in the Vietnam War. In 1964, Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, this allowed Johnson to use military force in Southeast Asia without an official declaration of war. The number of American military personnel in Vietnam increased dramatically, from roughly 160 advisors out of combat to 550,000 in early 1968, many in combat. American casualties soared and there was no progress in the peace area. Growing unease with the war stimulated a large, angry antiwar movement. Johnson had more trouble on his hands when summer riots broke out  in the major cities after 1965, and crime rates soared, as his opponents demanded "law and order" policies.
